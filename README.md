# Caesar-Cipher üîê

This is a simple C++ program that demonstrates basic text encryption and decryption using ASCII values. The program allows you to input a story, encrypt it by converting characters to their corresponding ASCII values, and save the encrypted data to a file. It also provides an option to decrypt the data and display the original story.

## ‚öíÔ∏èUsage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/saadarazzaq/Caesar-Cipher.git`.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd Caesar-Cipher`.

3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++): `g++ main.cpp -o encryption`.

4. Run the compiled program: `./encryption`.

5. The program will display a menu with options to encrypt and write to a file, decrypt and print from a file, or exit the program.

## üå†Features

- **Encryption**: Input a story and convert its characters to ASCII values, then save the encrypted data to a file.
- **Decryption**: Read the encrypted data from the file, convert ASCII values back to characters, and display the original story.
- **Menu-Driven**: User-friendly menu interface to choose between encryption, decryption, and program exit.

## üí°How It Works

1. Input a story and choose the encryption option.
2. The program converts each character of the story to its ASCII value and writes these values to a file.
3. Choose the decryption option.
4. The program reads the encrypted ASCII values from the file and converts them back to characters, printing the original story.
